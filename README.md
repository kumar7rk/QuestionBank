This project was developed during undergrad studies. The project was built on top of JAVA Swing, GUI widget toolkit. Basically, this project was quite comprehensive in terms of the functionalities it offers. For instance, students and teachers have a login credential which lets the former register for a paper, at a particular date and time, posted by the latter group. The results could be viewed within the next day. And the teacher could look at the overall performance of the class or an individual student.

The project was anticipated to run on the college server and therefore could be accessed from the labs itself.
