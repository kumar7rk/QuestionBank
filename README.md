This project was developed during underGrad studies. The project was built on top of JAVA Swing, GUI widget toolkit. Basically this project was quite comphrensive in terms of the funtionalities it offers. For instance, students and teachers have a login credentials which lets the former register for a paper, at a particular date and time, posted by the later group. The results could be viewed within the next day. And teacher could look at the overall performance of the class or an individual student. 

The project was anticipated to run on the college server and therefore could be accessed from the labs itself.
